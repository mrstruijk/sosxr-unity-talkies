M2MQTT for Unity
====================
This is a simple [Unity3d](http://unity3d.com/) project for using [M2MQTT](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.m2mqtt) with Unity.
The M2MQTT library was modified to run also on UWP/HoloLens.

An example scene is provided with a UI for controlling the connection to the broker and for testing messaging.

**Requires Unity 2017.1 or higher.**

## Getting started

An example scene is provided in M2MqttUnity/Examples/Scenes/M2MqttUnity_Test, with a UI for controlling the connection to a MQTT broker and to test publishing and receiving messages.
You can find in the same folder also a scene slightly changed to test the project in VR/AR/MR (M2MqttUnity_TestXR).

### The Broker

Setup the Mosquitto broker. A good explanation on how to set this up on Linux / Raspberry Pi can be found [here](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/install-mosquitto-linux/).
